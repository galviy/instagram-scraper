# instagram-scraper
tools for viewing instagram users information's through node js 

# note 
instagram's `api` can be replaced at any time, it means this tool only works with the given url by me so you have to manage the changes and recode the code  incase the `api` or the `Json structure` has been changed.

# instalation

`npm i node-fetch`
`node insta.js`
